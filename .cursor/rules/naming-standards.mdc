- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. is_active, has_permission).
- Use PascalCase for class, enum, and dataclass names (e.g., DsvReader, CsvWriter, TransformXmlToJson).
- For SQL, prefer lower case column names.
- Prefer upper snake case for constant names.
- Environment variable names MUST use a project prefix [A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*_ (e.g., SPLURGE_DSV_).
